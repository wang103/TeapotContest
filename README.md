CS 418 MP3 -- Teapot Contest  
By Tianyi Wang  


User interation:  

ESC or 'q':  quit the program.  
'r': start or pause teapot rotation.  
'c': turn on or off the teapot texture.  
'v': turn on or off the environment mapping.  
'b': turn on or off the lighting.  


Note:  
1. Shaders are not used in this program.  
2. Scene is rendered in perspective projection.  
3. Hidden surfaces are removed by using z-buffer.  
4. Environment mapping is done by using sphere mapping.  
5. There is one light source in the scene, and its position is slightly to the 
right side of the center, so right side of the teapot appears brighter than the 
left side.  
6. Texture coordinates are generated by OpenGL automatically.  
7. Code itself should be self-explanatory.  
8. The scene is running at 60 fps.  
9. GLEW library is integrated into this project at compile stage.  
Therefore on a machines that does not have GLEW installed as a shared library,  
this project can still be compiled independently, and the pre-compiled executable  
can still run.
